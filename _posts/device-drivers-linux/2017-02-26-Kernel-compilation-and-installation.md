## Choose Your Weapon

Nowadays we have multiple options to play around with Linux Kernel. For
simplicity sake, I classify the available approaches into three broad areas:
virtualisation, Desktop/Laptop, and embedded device. The virtualisation
technique is the safer way to conduct experiments with Linux kernel because any
fatal mistake has a few consequences. For example, if you crash the entire
system, you can create another virtual machine or take one of your backups
(yes, make a backup of your running kernel images). Experiment on your computer
is more fun, but also more risk. Any potential problem could break all your
system.  Finally, for the embedded device, you can make tests in a developing
kit. In this section, we choose our weapons. We will work first with Qemu,
followed by the local computer. 

If you want to use Qemu for work, I recommend you to read my post about it in "[Use Qemu to play with Linux Kernel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-26-use-qemu-to-play-with-linux %})"

## Get Your kernel

Linux project has many subsystems and most of them keep their clone of the
Kernel. Usually, the maintainer(s) of each subsystem is responsible for
receiving patches, and decide to apply or not the change. Later, the maintainer
says to Torvalds which branch to merge. This explanation is an
oversimplification of the process; you can find more details in the
documentation. It is important to realise that you have to figure out which
system you intend to contribute, discover their repository, and work based on
their branch. For example, if you want to contribute to RISC-V subsystem you
have to work on Palmer Dabbelt repository; if you're going to contribute to iio
use Jonathan Cameron repository. You can quickly figure out the target branch
by looking at the MAINTAINERS file. For this tutorial, we use the Torvalds
repository.  

```bash
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
```

There are thousands of forks from Linux Kernel spread around the Internet. It
is possible to find entire organisations that keep their branch of the Kernel
with their specific changes. Also, you can find a mirror from Torvalds on
Github. Few free to use it, but keep in mind that you may encounter some
problems with non-official repositories. I prefer to use the git.kernel.org to
use because it simplifies future works.

## The Super `.config` file

[comment]: <> (Revisar daqui para baixo)

The `.config` file keeps all the configurations used during the Kernel
compilation. In this file, you can find which subsystem and configuration will
be compiled or not. The `.config` file has three possible answers per target:
(1) m, (2) y, and (3) n. The "m" character means that the target will be
compiled as a module; the 'y' and 'n' designates if the target will be compiled
or not as a part of the Kernel image.

Every Linux Distribution (e.g., Arch, Debian, and Fedora) usually maintain and
distribute their own `.config` file. The distributions `.config` file; normally
enables most of the available options (especially the device drivers) because
they have to run in a large variety of hardware. It means that you may have
various device driver on your computer that you do not need. Nonetheless, the
important thing here is: the more options you have enabled in the `.config`
file, more time will be taken by the compilation.

If it is your first attempt to use your own compiled kernel version, I strongly
recommend you to use the `.config` file provided by your distribution to
increase the chances of success. Later, you can expand the modification as we
describe in this tutorial.

If it is your first attempt to use your own compiled kernel version, I strongly
recommend you to use the `.config` file provided by your distribution to
increase the chances of success. Later, you can customize things as we describe
in this tutorial.

**Attention:**
The `.config` file has Superpower, I recommend you to invest some time to
understand it better. Also, save your working `.config` files, it will save
time for you.
{: .notice_danger}

### Get your `.config` file

Depending on the distribution which you use, there are two options to get
`.config` file: from `/proc`, or `/boot`. Both cases produce the same results,
but it is not all distribution that enables `/proc` option (e.g., Arch enable
it, but Debian not). The command bellow makes the copy, notice that I suppose
that you are in the Linux Kernel directory (previously cloned).

1. Get `.config` from `/proc`

```bash
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
```

2. Get `.config` from `/boot`

```bash
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
```

### Make your customizations

**Attention:**
There is a basic rule about `.config` file: NEVER CHANGE IT BY HAND, ALWAYS USE
A TOOL
{: .notice_danger}

There are several options to change the `.config` manually file. I introduce
two:

```bash
make nconfig
```

`nconfig` looks like this:

{% capture fig_img %}
![Foo]({{ site.url }}/images/nconfig.png)
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>nconfig</figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, we have `menuconfig`:

```bash
make menuconfig
```

`menuconfig` looks like this:

{% capture fig_img %}
![Foo]({{ site.url }}/images/menuconfig.png)
{% endcapture %}

<figure>
  {{ fig_img | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" }}
  <figcaption>Menuconfig</figcaption>
</figure>

### Final considerations about `.config` and tips

When you use a configuration file provided by a Linux Distribution, hundreds of
device drivers are enabled; typically, you need a few drivers. All the enabled
drivers will raise the compile time with no need for you; fortunately, there is
an option that automatically changes the `.config` file to enable only required
drivers. Nonetheless, before using the command, it is highly recommended to
enable all the devices that you use with your computer to ensure that `.config`
file have all the required driver for your machine enabled. In other words,
plug all the devices that you usually use before executing the command:

```bash
make localmodconfig
```

**Remember:**
Enables all the device
{: .notice_info}

This command, basically uses `lsmod` to check the enables or disables devices drivers in the `.config` file.

[//]: <> (TODO: Seria legal simular isso aqui)

Sometimes, when you rebase your local master branch with the remote you will notice when try to compile that some questions are raised related to the ativation or deactiavion of features. This happens, because during the evolution of the Kernel new features are added that was not in present in you `.config` file. As a result, you are asked to take a decision. Sometimes, there is a way to partially reduce the amount of asked question with the command:

```bash
make olddefconfig
```

Finally, one last tip is related for someone that make experiments in the Qemu with Kvm. There is an option that enables some important features for this scenario:

```bash
make kvmconfig
```

## Compile!

Now, it timeeeeee! After a bunch of setup, I am quite sure that you anxious for this part. So, here we go... type:

```bash
make -j [two_times_the_number_of_core]
```

[//]: <> (TODO: Seria legal expandir a explicação do dobro dos cores)
Just replace the `two_times_the_number_of_core` for the number of cores you have by two. For example, if you have 8 cores you should add 16.

This command uses `lsmod` to check the enables or disables devices drivers in
the `.config` file.

```bash
make ARCH=x86_64 -j [two_times_the_number_of_core]
```

For compiling the kernel modules, type:

```bash
make modules_install
```

## Install new your custom kernel

It is important to pay attention in the installation order; we install modules
as following:

1. Install modules
2. Install header
3. Install Image
4. Update bootloader (Grub)

**Attention:**
Double your attention in the install steps. You can crash your system because
you have executed all commands as a root user.
{: .notice_danger}

### Install modules and headers

Just type:

```bash
sudo make modules_install
```

If you want to check the changes, take a look at `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`

Finally, install headers:

```bash
sudo make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/usr
```

### Install new image (works on Debian)

Finally, it is time to install your Kernel image. This step does not work on
Arch Linux, see next section if you are interested in Arch.

To install the Kernel module just type:

```bash
sudo make install
```

We are, reallyyyyy close to finishing the process. We have to update the
bootloader, and here we suppose you are using Grub. Type:

```bash
sudo update-grub2
```

Notice, that the command below is a wrapper to the following command:

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

So... If the first command fails, try the last one.

Now, reboot your system and check if everything is ok.

### Arch Linux Installation

If you use Arch Linux, we present the basics steps to install your custom
image. You can find a detailed explanation of this processes in the Arch Linux [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Traditional_compilation).

First, you have copied your kernel image to the `/boot/` directory with the
command: 

```bash
sudo cp -v arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-[name]
```

Replace [name] by any name. It could be your name.

Second, you have to create a new `mkinitcpio`. Follow the steps below:

1. Copy an existing `mkinitcpio`

```bash
sudo cp /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.present /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-[name].present
```

2. Open the copied file, and look it line by line and replaces the old kernel
name by the name you assigned. See the example:

**Attention:**
Keep in mind that you have to adapt this file by yourself. There is no blind
copy and paste here.
{: .notice_danger}

3. Generate the initramfs

```bash
sudo mkinitcpio -p linux-[name].prensent
```

## Remove

Finally, you may want to remove an old Kernel version for space or organization
reasons. First of all, boot in another version of the Kernel and follow the
steps below:

```bash
rm -rf /boot/vmlinuz-[target]
rm -rf /boot/initrd-[target]
rm -rf /boot/System-map-[target]
rm -rf /boot/config-[target]
rm -rf /lib/modules/[target]
rm -rf /var/lib/initramfs/[target]
```
